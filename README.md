# HELLO EVERYONE! = console.log('HELLO EVERYONE!');
I am Vincent Impreveduto. The language I speak is Software Engineering. My passion is to build and manage technological data and applications with programming languages. I analyze what I am coding, and implement tested code that creates an infrastructure to operate applications. When complications occur, I configure until they're solved. By hiring me, you have someone dedicated to being skillful and reliable. I take pride in my coding and the company that hires me! 

My interest for coding derives from my AA Graphic Design Web Design classes; I had to develop and host web sites. I used coding languages to develop sites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I received A's for all grades within all of the classes. Although Web Design and Software Engineering are like night and day, my coding passion has led me to the field of Software Engineering, and drives me to be the best Software Engineer I can be! 

My USF Software Engineer Coding Bootcamp and portfolio projects give me the knowledge, skills, and experience to analyze, write, and test software. I plan before I code in order to create more accurate and dependable code. I develop tested code piece by piece for quality solutions that prevent bugs. Companies may assure I achieve programming tasks efficiently. Please contact me to further discuss myself and opportunities you may have. Check out some of my working applications, below.
