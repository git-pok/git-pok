# console.log("HELLO EVERYONE!"); 
I am Vincent Impreveduto. The language I speak is Software Engineering. My passion is to engineer and test software applications, while achieving optimal functional results. I define documented and tested logic that is highly efficient for each logical purpose, and have mastered skills, methodologies, and technologies in front-end web development, back-end web development, full-stack web development, databases, data structures, and algorithms. By hiring me, you have someone who cares about your software concerns! I turn software concerns into code that senior developers approve of!

The USF Software Engineer Coding Bootcamp, a 9 month intensive course in Software Engineering methodologies and technologies with 700+ hours of hands-on course material and 1:1 industry expert mentor oversight, gives me the knowledge, skills, and experience to analyze, write, and test software. I have built and tested hundreds of front end/back end/full stack applications with many languages, libraries, and frameworks. I have also complete hundreds of exercises that allow me to throughly familiarize front end/back end architectures, components, and functionalities. Applications and features may trust I will program them efficiently. Please contact me to further discuss myself and opportunities you may have. Check out some of my working applications and capstone, below.
